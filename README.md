My github account will showcase my coding projects as  I progress in my CTI 110 class. I am new to programming so this will be a great experience for the future! I can't wait to see what I will be working on and to watch my growth in real time!
This repository contains a brief description about me and what I will be doing as the repository grows!
In order to create my repository, I created a unique URL (not TOO unique, it was based on my username.) and I checked the box to create a README.md file. Next I clicked on the "+" icon in the top left corner of the screen and selected "Clone a repository." This opened a window that showed a list of my Github repository. Once I chose the repository I wanted to clone, I was able to download the clone on my local machine (laptop) into a folder located on my desktop for easy accesiblity.
